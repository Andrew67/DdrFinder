/**
 * Jumps straight into launching DDR Calc as a Custom Tab (with Webview fallback).
 * Doesn't employ all the tricks from the TWA launcher activity, so future work may be needed.
 * See <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/android-browser-helper/blob/main/androidbrowserhelper/src/main/java/com/google/androidbrowserhelper/trusted/LauncherActivity.java">android-browser-helper LauncherActivity</a>
 *
 * <p>Currently lacks support for shortcuts as it causes the Custom Tab to re-open every time.
